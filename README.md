# rhodes-5.4.0
This is a working RubyGem for Rhodes-5.4.0

Steps:

Simply download or `git clone` the repo

Extract `rhodes-5.4.0.gem`

Run `gem install rhodes-5.4.0.gem` in Terminal

Builds hosted by Motorola themselves result in a failed install because the RubyGem `json-1.5.4` is the base level json dependency. Most devs are developing with Ruby 2.0 and up. `json-1.8.2` seems to work best with newer versions of Ruby.
